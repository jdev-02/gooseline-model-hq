    epa_season_revert and form_season_revert are experiment knobs and default to
    1.0, which is no change: state carries across the offseason at full strength,
    exactly as it always has. Below 1.0 the deviation from the league mean is
    multiplied by that factor at each season boundary, the same shape of
    treatment kalman.py already applies to team ratings (season_revert 0.7).

    They exist because that asymmetry is accidental rather than considered: the
    ratings admit a roster turns over and the EPA features do not. Whether
    fixing it helps is a question for walk-forward, not for taste, so the
    default stays where the tuned numbers were measured.
