"""Per-team, per-game EPA and CPOE, aggregated from nflverse play-by-play.

Two modes, and the difference matters.

A full build walks every season from scratch and is a once-ever job: it pulls
about 300 MB of parquet and takes minutes. It short-circuits on the cache file,
which is right for a first run and wrong for everything after, because that is
how team_game_stats.csv sat at 2025 week 18 while games.csv kept moving.

A refresh recomputes exactly one season and splices it into the cache. That is
the weekly job. It always re-downloads, because a season in progress grows every
Sunday and a cached copy of it is precisely the thing that goes stale. The rest
of the file is left untouched, byte for byte, so a refresh is cheap and its diff
shows only the games that were actually added.

Note the REG filter below: postseason games have never carried EPA rows, so team
EPA state coasts through January on regular season values. That is pre-existing
behaviour, left alone here deliberately, since changing it would change the
model's inputs and belongs behind a walk-forward comparison rather than inside a
staleness fix.
